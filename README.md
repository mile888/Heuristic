- [x] **Cohere**: Generative [model](https://docs.cohere.ai/docs/generation-card) `command-xlarge-nightly` which allow us to extract the answer to the user's query from the extracted passage. We used Cohere also to  encode user conversation (embedding vectors). We use 
- [x] **Qdrant**: The vector search engine (`1GB RAM - 0.5 vCPU - 20GB DISK`) we have used after making a [benchmark](https://github.com/qdrant/vector-db-benchmark) of {Qdrant, Milvus, Faiss}. After evaluation, Qdrant is the fastest way to search index and very easy manipulate collections (intuitively).
- [x] **Slack_bolt**: It is a Python framework that makes it easier to build Slack apps with the platform's latest features. We could have been able to distribute the slack app (via OAuth & Permissions), but due to time constrains, the app is running on our [Heuristic AI Slack server](https://join.slack.com/t/heuristicai/shared_invite/zt-1reg204at-6BlH_V5E4r18BnpZX2JByA), you can join easily and test it features.
- [x] **Ngrok**: It is a simplified API that adds connect local wep appplication to the any cloud. It forward all user query to Amazon EC2 which make the text generation üèóÔ∏è
- [x] **Amazon EC2**: Used to host the ngrok, and slack_app
